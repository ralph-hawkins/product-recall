          Whirlpool AKM274/IX Gas Hob 
        </h3>
          <p>
            Whirlpool stainless steel, built-in gas hobs with the model number AKM 274/IX, manufactured between September&nbsp;2014 and March&nbsp;2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            In very rare usage conditions the front-left hob leaks carbon monoxide which can be a low risk of adverse health effects through inhalation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an affected appliance, Whirlpool advises not to use the burner in the front-left corner until it has been repaired by a Whirlpool engineer.
